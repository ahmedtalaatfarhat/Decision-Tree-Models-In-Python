# Decision-Tree-Models-In-Python

I  created a simple decision tree model to classify countries into low and high happiness based on life expectancy and unemployment.
I used a really tiny data set with just 12 rows(world_data_really_tiny.csv). This is unrealistic for any real machine learning,
but it is an Example for building a decision tree model.
